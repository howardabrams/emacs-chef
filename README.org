Still unclear what we are actually building, so most of this is
currently an experiment.

* Dependencies

  To play with this, currently, you will need:

  - [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][Dash]] ... installed via MELPA
  - Magnar's string library, [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][Project S]]

  We'll need something like the [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-rsa][Emacs RSA]] project, but we will
  download and install that directly.
